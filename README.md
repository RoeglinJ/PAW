# PAW

### OVERVIEW ###
**PAW** is a 3D **P**rintable **A**rduino-based **W**heel logger.  An inexpensive (~$75 CAD) alternative to commercial running wheel systems, PAW provides 1/100 second resolution while tracking the wheel running activity of mice in the home cage.  This compact and wireless design is easy to assemble, with the electronics themselves taking under an hour to put together.  The ease of manufacturing is matched by the ease of analysis, as PAW saves all running wheel data to an on-board MicroSD card in an easily accessible CSV format.

For detailed instructions on the assembly and use of the PAW system, please see the appropriate sections of this GitHub repository.
