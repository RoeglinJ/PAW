  This script is to be used to track the timing of wheel rotations in the running wheel projects
  The circuit:
    Hall Sensor (KY-003):
      1: GND
      2: 5V
      3: (s-side) pin A5
    RTC (DS3231):
      GND: GND
      VCC: 5V
      SDA: A4
      SCL: A3
    MicroSD Card Adapter:
      CS: pin 4
      SCK: pin 13
      MOSI: pin 11
      MISO: pin 12
      VCC: 5V
      GND: GND
